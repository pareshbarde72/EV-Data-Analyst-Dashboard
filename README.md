⚡ EV Data Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

This project presents a data-driven dashboard developed in Power BI to analyze Electric Vehicle (EV) datasets with a focus on adoption trends, Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility, and geographic distribution. The solution integrates data modeling, transformation, and visualization techniques to deliver actionable insights for stakeholders such as policymakers, manufacturers, and researchers.

The dataset contains 1,796 vehicle records, all of which are classified as Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). A key KPI highlights the average electric range at 30.78M miles, providing performance benchmarks across the dataset. To refine classification, the analysis segments vehicles into CAFV Eligible (68.99%) and CAFV Unknown (31.01%), ensuring decision-makers can assess policy-driven adoption categories.

From a manufacturer’s perspective, the Make and Model analysis emphasizes BMW as the core contributor, with models including the BMW i4, i3, and iX, accounting for the entire fleet in this dataset. A time-series analysis by Model Year (2014–2024) illustrates adoption growth, with a sharp increase observed around 2022. This highlights industry scaling in response to consumer demand and regulatory incentives.

Geospatial analysis is enabled through map visualizations, showing vehicle distribution across U.S. states. This regional breakdown allows the identification of EV concentration zones, useful for infrastructure planning such as charging station deployment.

On the technical side, the project leverages Power Query for data cleaning and transformation, while DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) powers KPI measures and calculated fields such as total vehicles and CAFV proportions. The dashboard design combines cards, donut charts, line graphs, and filled maps to facilitate intuitive storytelling and interactivity. Filters such as EV Type and Make allow dynamic exploration of data.

In summary, this project demonstrates how business intelligence tools can be applied to the automotive sector for sustainability insights. By integrating data modeling, DAX-driven KPIs, and interactive visualizations, the dashboard transforms raw EV data into an analytical framework that supports strategic planning and accelerates the transition toward sustainable transportation.
