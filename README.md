⚡ EV Data Analysis Dashboard – Power BI ⚡

Designed and deployed an advanced Power BI dashboard for Electric Vehicle analytics, integrating Power Query for ETL pipelines and DAX measures for KPIs, segmentation, and time-series calculations. Processed 1,796 BEV records, computing an avg. electric range of 30.78M miles and classifying vehicles into CAFV Eligible (68.99%) vs. CAFV Unknown (31.01%) for policy analysis. Manufacturer breakdown revealed BMW (i4, i3, iX) as 100% of dataset, while year-wise adoption (2014–2024) indicated a sharp growth post-2022 driven by regulatory incentives. Implemented geospatial mapping for state-level EV distribution to optimize charging infrastructure planning.
The dashboard architecture included dimension/fact data modeling, calculated tables, and custom DAX measures for KPIs like total EV count, CAFV proportion, and range benchmarks. Visualization layer leveraged cards, donut charts, line graphs, and filled maps with slicer-based interactivity (EV Type, Make, Model Year) to enable multi-dimensional insights. Delivered a scalable BI solution supporting policy evaluation, market trend forecasting, and sustainability planning.
⚡ EV Data Analysis Dashboard – Power BI ⚡
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing 1,796 Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) with an average range of 30.78M miles. Vehicles segmented into CAFV Eligible (68.99%) vs CAFV Unknown (31.01%) to support policy-based adoption insights. Manufacturer analysis shows BMW (i3 – 592, i4 – 713, iX – 491) as the complete dataset contributor.

**Key Features:**

Time-series visualization (2014–2024): Sharp adoption growth post-2022.

Geospatial mapping: State-wise EV distribution to identify adoption hotspots.

Dynamic slicers: EV Type and Make for interactive drill-down.

KPIs & Charts: Cards, donut chart, line graph, map, and tabular summary powered by DAX-driven measures for totals, proportions, and benchmarks.

The dashboard integrates ETL (Power Query), semantic modeling, and DAX calculations, delivering actionable insights for policy evaluation, infrastructure planning, and EV adoption strategy.
